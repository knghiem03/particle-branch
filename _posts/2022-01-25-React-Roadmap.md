I took two React courses via Pluralsight.com. It was good but I don't have enough hands-on practice.
I finally found one that is really fun to learn and challeging at the same time.

**React - The Complete Guide (includes Hooks, React Router, and Redux) [2021 Updated] - Second Edition**

The first chapter is a good review of JS ES6 to prepare you for the course. Practice and be sure you master
it before moving on to the next chapter.
