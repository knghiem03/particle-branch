[tic-tac-toe](https://knghiem03.github.io/React_tic_tac_toe/) game is a React learning project from the official React website.
The following improvements were implemented:

1. Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.

***TBD***
Bold the currently selected item in the move list.
Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw.
