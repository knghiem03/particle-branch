This is the first React app in the Packt training series. This project was completed under guidance from the videos in the course. It is very challenging and fullfilling experience. I try to solve the problems using what I have learned fron the videos, then cross check my approach and code it without the videos. At the end, I copied the CSS file from the course repo to achieve consistence look with the course material.
