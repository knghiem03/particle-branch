The Target Intern **WE** team works on this pro-bono project to extend the current [World Encounter](https://worldencounter.org/) website powered by Leadpages.
Shopify ecommerce store and Kindful payment gateway were integrated into the World Encounter website.  

In this project, the team learned about requirement definitions, planning, project goals and execution via the Agile methodology.
